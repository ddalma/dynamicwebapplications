Portfolio Website for Prof. Lutwak

A portfolio website created for Prof. Lutwak, Head of the Mathematics Dept. of NYU Poly School of Engineering.
This project invovles me not only using my knowledge of HTML & CSS, but also utilizing Bootstrap for the first time.
Using the framework bootstrap will making designing websites much more fast and overall easier, if given the time, I
will also try to make the website dynamic, or more dynamic, using the JavaScript language as well the AngularJs
framework, utilizing the skills I learned for my internship at Walmart of Summer 2015.
